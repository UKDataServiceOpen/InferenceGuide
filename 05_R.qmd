# R  {.unnumbered}

The R *Survey* package [@Lumley2023] provides a comprehensive set of
functions for computing point and variance estimates from survey data.
At the same time, R Base does not provide a unified sets of commands or
syntax for computing weighted estimates. Implementation of statistical
theory may vary between packages, but algorithms are usually described
in detail in the package documentation.

In the example below, we will practice statistical inference with data from
the [2017 British Social Attitudes Survey
     (BSA)](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8450)
taking into account weights and survey design variables. Please note
that at the time of writing this document only some issues of the BSA
include survey design variables.

## Identifying the survey design and variables

We first need to find out about the survey design that was used in the
2017 BSA, and the design variables that are made available in the
dataset. Such information can usually be found in the documentation that
comes together with the data under the `mrdoc/pdf` folder.

**Question 1** What is the design that was used in this survey (i.e. how
                                                                many stages were there, and what were the units sampled). What were the
primary sampling units; the strata (if relevant)?
  
  Now that we are a bit more familiar with the way the survey was
designed, we need to try and identify the design variables we can
include when producing estimates. The information can usually be found
in the user manual or the data dictionary available under
`mrdoc/ukda_data_dictionaries.zip` The file may need to be decompressed
separately.

**Question 2** What survey design variables are available? Are there any
ones that are missing -- if so which ones? What is the name of the
weights variables?
  
  ## Specifying the survey design
  
```{r 5.1, echo=-9:-7,message=F,warning=F}
rm(list=ls())

library(haven) ### Importing stata/SPSS files
library(Hmisc) ### Extra statistical functions
library(survey) ### Survey design functions
library(kableExtra) ### Survey design functions

#setwd("C:/Users/mscsepw2/OneDrive - The University of Manchester/Surveyskills")
#setwd("~/Dropbox/work/UKDS/DSP/DSP-core-inference") ### Edit as appropriate
setwd("~/OneDrive/SSP/DSP-core-inference") ### Edit as appropriate
datadir<-"~/Data/"                ### Edit as appropriate
#datadir<-"~/Dropbox/work/UKDS/data/"                ### Edit as appropriate
bsa17<-read_spss(paste0(datadir,"bsa/UKDA-8450-spss/spss/spss25/bsa2017_for_ukda.sav"))
dim(bsa17)
```

We can specify the survey design earlier identified in the data
documentation: using `Spoint` as Primary Sampling Unit, `StratID` as
strata, and `WtFactor` as weights. R does this by creating a `svydesign`
object, i.e. a survey design informed version of the data, which will be
used for subsequent estimation.

```{r 5.2}
bsa17.s<-svydesign(ids=~Spoint, strata=~StratID, weights=~WtFactor,data=bsa17)
class(bsa17.s)
```

## Mean age and its 95% confidence interval

We can now produce a first set of estimates using this information and
compare them with those we would have got without accounting for the
survey design. We will compute the average (i.e. mean) age of
respondents in the sample. We will need to use `svymean()`

```{r mean}
svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s)
```

By default `svymean()` computes the standard error of the mean. We need
to\
embed it within `confint()` in order to get a confidence interval.

```{r 5.3}
confint(svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s)) ### Just the confidence interval...
round(
  c(
    svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s),
    confint(svymean(~RAgeE,bsa17.s))
  ),
  1)### Estimate and CI, rounded
```

**Question 3** What would be the consequences of weighing but not
accounting for the sample design; not using weights and accounting for
the sample design when:
  
  -   inferring the mean value of the population age?
  -   inferring the uncertainty of our estimate of the population age?
  
  ## Computing a proportion and its 95% confidence interval
  
  We can now similarly compute the distribution of a categorical variable
in the population by estimating proportions (or percentages), for
instance, the proportion of people who declare that they are interested
in politics. This is the `Politics` variable in the BSA. It has five
categories ranging from 1 'A great deal' to 5- 'Not at all'. We could
recode 1 and 2 - `quite a lot` into 'Significantly', but since we are
only interested in estimating the confidence intervals, we will select
the relevant values 'on the go'.

```{r 5.4}
attr(bsa17$Politics,"label")     ### Phrasing of the question
attr(bsa17$Politics,"labels")     ### Value labels

table(as_factor(bsa17$Politics)) ### Sample distribution

```

**Note**: Changes in a data frame are not automatically transferred into
`svydesign` objects used for inferences. We therefore need to recreate
it each time we create or recode a variable.

```{r 5.5}
round(100*prop.table(svytable(~(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s)),1)
```

Let us now compute the confidence intervals for these proportions.
Traditional statistical software compute these without giving us an idea
of the underlying computations going on. Doing this in R requires more
coding, but also a better understanding of what is actually estimated.

Confidence intervals for proportions of categorical variables are
usually computed as a sequence of binomial/dichotomic estimations --
  i.e. one for each category. In R this needs to be specified explicitly
via the `svyciprop()` and `I()` functions. The former actually computes
the proportion and its confidence interval (by default 95%), whereas the
latter allows us to define the category we are focusing on.

```{r 5.6}
svyciprop(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s)
round(100*
        c(prop.table(svytable(~(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s))[2],
          attr(svyciprop(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),bsa17.s),"ci")),1
)
```

**Question 4** What is the proportion of respondents aged 17-34 in the
sample, as well as its 95% confidence interval? You can use `RAgecat5`

## Computing domain estimates

Computing domain estimates, that is estimates for subgroups adds a layer
of complexity to the above example. They key point is that as weights
are usually  designed using the whole of the sample by data producers, confidence intervals or standard errors computed using only part of the
sample may be unreliable, as they will rely on some of the  weights only.  Instead, it is recommended to use commands that take into
account the entire distribution of the weights.

In R, the command that does this is `svyby()`

For instance, if we would like to compute the mean age of BSA
respondents by Government Office Regions, we need to specify:
  
  -   The outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: i.e. `RAgeE`
-   The grouping variable(s) `GOR_ID`
-   The estimate function we are going to use here: `svymean`, the same
as we used before
-   And the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see
displayed i.e. standard errors or confidence interval

```{r 5.7}
round(
  svyby(~RAgeE,by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),svymean,design=bsa17.s,vartype = "ci")[-1]
  ,1)
```

*Note:* we used `[-1]` from the object created by `svyby()` in order to
remove a column with alphanumeric values (the region names), so that we
could round the results without getting an error.

Our inference seem to suggest that the population in London is among the
youngest in the country, and that those in the South West are among the
oldest -- their respective 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. We
should not feel so confident about differences between London and the
South East for example, as the CIs partially overlap.

We can follow a similar approach with proportions: we just need to
specify the category of the variable we are interested in as an outcome,
for instance respondents who are significantly interested in politics,
and replace `svymean` by `svyciprop`.

```{r 5.8}
round(
  100*
    svyby(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),
          by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),
          svyciprop,
          design=bsa17.s,
          vartype = "ci")[-1],
  1)
```

**Question 5** What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of
people interested in politics in the South West? Is the proportion
likely to be different in London? In what way? What is the region of the
UK for which the precision of the estimates is likely to be the
smallest?
  
  **Question 6** Using interest in politics as before, and three category
age `RAgecat5`:
  
  -   Produce a table of results showing the proportion of respondents
significantly interested in Politics by age group and gender

-   Assess whether the age difference in interest for politics is
similar for each gender?
  
  -   Based on the data, is it fair to say that men aged under 35 tend to
be more likely to declare themselves interested in politics than
women aged 55 and above?
  
  ## Inference without survey design variables using R
  
  *Example: count and proportion of the regional population of the UK
using the LFS with End User License (EUL)*
  
  As a rule, EUL versions of the LFS do not include sample design
variables. On the other hand they come with two weight variables:
  
  -   `pwt22` for estimation with the whole sample
-   `piwt22` for estimation of income using respondents currently in
employment (and accounting for the high level of non response for
            the earnings variables)

Estimation without accounting for sample design will likely be biased
and should be reported as such including warnings, even if the nature
(over or underestimation of the precision) and and size are not known.
An alternative is to look for design effects tables published by the
data producer which could be used to correct for the bias.

The Office for National Statistics regularly publishes such tables for
the LFS, albeit mostly for their headline statistics. Obtaining further
design effects for subpopulations might not be straighforward. The
overall methodology is described [in this
                                  note](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/methodologicalpublications/generalmethodology/onsworkingpaperseries/onsmethodologyworkingpaperseriesno9guidetocalculatingstandarderrorsforonssocialsurveys#annex-a-labour-force-survey-standard-errors-january-to-march-2015-united-kingdom),
                                        and updated tables are provided [on this
                                                                         page](Volume%201:%20Background%20and%20methodology%20(PDF,%201.2MB)).

Let's see how this can be achieved. But first, let's produce uncorrected
'naive' estimates of the regional population.

```{r  5.9}
lfs<-read_dta((paste0(datadir,"lfs/UKDA-8999-stata/lfsp_aj22_eul_pwt22.dta")))%>%
  select(PWT22,PIWT22,URESMC,ILODEFR)
names(lfs)<-tolower(names(lfs))
lfs$uresmc.f<-droplevels(as_factor(lfs$uresmc))
lfs.s<-svydesign(ids=~1,weights=~piwt22,data=lfs%>%filter(ilodefr==1)) 
round(confint(svytotal(~uresmc.f,lfs.s)))
```

In the above example, we are working with the most commonly used flavour
of the Labour Force Survey: the quarterly edition. The specific dataset
used above is the April-July 2022 issue. Looking at the latest version
of the documentation mentioned above - Volume 1, Annex C, we can see a
list of design effects for the number of employed respondents by Region
of Usual Residence.

![LFS design
  factors](pics/lfs_vol1_SE.png){fig-alt="Screenshot of LFS documentation Volume 1, Annex C showing Design Effects"}

We can see that for some reason, the number of regions has been reduced
from the original 16 to 13. We therefore need to recode our original
variable.

```{r 5.10}
lfs<-lfs%>%mutate(uresmc.fn=case_when(
  lfs$uresmc.f=="Tyne & Wear" | 
    lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of Northern region" ~ "North East",
  lfs$uresmc.f=="South Yorkshire" |
    lfs$uresmc.f== "West Yorkshire" | 
    lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of Yorks & Humberside" ~ "Yorkshire & Humberside",
  lfs$uresmc.f=="Inner London" | 
    lfs$uresmc.f== "Outer London"~"London",
  lfs$uresmc.f=="West Midlands (met county)" |
    lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of West Midlands"~"West Midlands",
  lfs$uresmc.f=="Greater Manchester" |
    lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of North West" ~ "North West",
  lfs$uresmc.f=="Strathclyde" |
    lfs$uresmc.f== "Rest of Scotland"~"Scotland",
  .default=uresmc.f
))
```

For convenience, reorder the factor levels in order to match the ONS
ordering:
  
```{r 5.11}

lfs$uresmc.fn<-as.factor(lfs$uresmc.fn)
lfs$uresmc.fn<-factor(
  lfs$uresmc.fn,
  levels = levels(lfs$uresmc.fn)[c(5,6,4,13,2,12,1,3,8,10,11,9,7)])
```

Let us now check the results:
  
```{r 5.12}
lfs.s<-svydesign(ids=~1,weights=~piwt22,data=lfs%>%filter(ilodefr==1)) 
round(confint(svytotal(~uresmc.fn,lfs.s)))
```

We can now import the design factors from the LFS documentation. This
has to be done by hand, by directly copying the relevant numbers from
the LFS.

While we are at it we can also improve the original table:
  
```{r 5.13}
tot<-data.frame(svytotal(~uresmc.fn,lfs.s))
tot$deft<-c(0.8712,1.0857,1.3655,1.0051,0.9634,
            1.0382,0.8936,1.3272,0.9677,0.9137,
            1.0012,1.0437,0.7113)
tot["2.5%"]<-tot$total-(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)
tot["97.5%"]<-tot$total+(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)
rownames(tot)<-substr(rownames(tot),10,nchar(rownames(tot)))
kable(round(tot[,c("2.5%","97.5%")]))
```

### Answers

**Question 1** The 2017 BSA is a three stage stratified random survey,
with postcode sectors, adresses and individuals as the units selected at
each stage. Primary sampling units were stratified according to
geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of
owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode
sectors (i.e. number of addresses).

**Question 2** From the Data Dictionary it appears that the primary
sampling units (sub regions) are identified by `Spoint` and the strata
by `StratID`. The weights variable is `WtFactor`. Addresses are not
provided but could be approximated with a household identifier.

**Question 3** Not using weights would make us overestimate the mean age
in the population (of those aged 16+) by about 4 years. This is likely
to be due to the fact that older respondents are more likely to take
part to surveys. Using survey design variables does not alter the value
of the estimated population mean. However, not accounting for it would
lead us to overestimate the precision/underestimate the uncertainty of
our estimate with a narrower confidence interval -- by about plus or
minus 3 months.

**Question 4** The proportion of 17-34 year old in the sample is
`r round(100*as.numeric(svyciprop(~I(RAgecat5 == 1),bsa17.s)[1]),1)` and
its 95% confidence interval
`r round(100*attr(svyciprop(~I(RAgecat5 == 1),bsa17.s),"ci"),1)`

**Question 5** The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people
interested in politics in the South West is 39.8-53.4. By contrast, it
is 47.6-60.8 in London. The region with the lowest precision of
estimates (i.e. the widest confidence interval) is Wales, with a 20
percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the
confidence interval.

**Question 6**
  
```{r 5.14,echo=F}
bsa17$Politics.s<-ifelse(bsa17$Politics==1 |
                           bsa17$Politics==2,"Significantly",NA)
bsa17$Politics.s<-ifelse(bsa17$Politics>=3 &
                           bsa17$Politics<=5,"Not Interested",bsa17$Politics.s)
bsa17$Politics.s<-as.factor(bsa17$Politics.s)

bsa17$RAgecat5.f<-as_factor(bsa17$RAgecat5)
bsa17$Rsex.f<-as_factor(bsa17$Rsex)

bsa17.s<-svydesign(ids=~Spoint+Sserial, 
                   strata=~StratID, 
                   weights=~WtFactor,
                   data=bsa17)

round(
  100*svyby(
    ~I(Politics.s=="Significantly"),
    by=~RAgecat5.f+Rsex.f,
    svyciprop,
    design=bsa17.s,
    vartype = "ci")[c(-8,-4),c(-2,-1)]
  ,1)
```

Older respondents both male and female tend to be more involved in
politics than younger ones.

The confidence interval for the proportion of men under 35 and women
above 55 interested in politics overlaps; it is unlikely that they
differ in the population.
