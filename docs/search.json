    "text": "Introduction\nThis guide discusses the practical steps required to produce reliable population estimates with survey data curated by the UK Data Service. It focuses on how and when to use survey weights and design variables, and is aimed at users unfamiliar with the technical aspects of sample theory and survey design.\nRobust ie reliable population inference is a complex topic\nPopulation inference from survey data requires drawing from four domains: statistical theory (sampling distributions, parameter estimation, design effects, weighting), study-specific design issues (stratification, clustering, non-response), software estimation procedures and functions (inconsistent implementation, unclear documentation), and the secondary researcher/user’s own sets of circumstances (ie what they can hope to produce given available data and time/resources constraints).\nTeaching gaps\nProducing weighted survey estimates is routinely excluded from introductory methods courses due to time constraints, resource limitations, and perceived complexity. This leaves researchers and analysts with significant knowledge gaps in their survey analysis skills.\nProblematic Research Practices\nThis gap potentially results in two problematic outcomes. Some users may be tempted to rely on undocumented, “quick and dirty” approaches to population inference, sometimes not giving enough consideration to whether techniques are methodologically appropriate to the data and their research aims. Others avoid working with survey datasets entirely, believing they lack necessary skills. Both responses limit effective use of valuable social research infrastructure.\nPurpose of these guidelines\nThe guidelines below attempt to address these challenges by documenting plain English procedures for robust population inference using surveys microdata available at the UK Data Service. It relies on examples from the Labour Force Survey, Family Expenditure Survey, and British Social Attitudes survey with examples in R, Stata and SPSS. The aim is enabling confident implementation of robust estimation strategies regardless of mathematical background.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[Target Population] --&gt; B[Survey Sample]\n    B --&gt; C{Raw Data Analysis}\n    B --&gt; D{Weighted Analysis}\n    \n    C --&gt; E[Biased Estimates]\n    D --&gt; F[Robust Estimates]\n    \n    G[Survey Design Effects] --&gt; H[Survey Weights]\n    I[Non-response] --&gt; H\n    J[Coverage Errors] --&gt; H\n    \n    H --&gt; D\n    K[Design Variables] --&gt; D\n    \n    E --&gt; L[❌ Unreliable Inference]\n    F --&gt; M[✅ Valid Inference]\n    \n    style A fill:#e1f5fe\n    style F fill:#c8e6c9\n    style E fill:#ffcdd2\n    style M fill:#c8e6c9\n    style L fill:#ffcdd2\n\n\n Flowchart: robust population inference \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlair, Johnny. 2014.

    "text": "1.1 Clustering in Survey Sampling\nAt the heart of survey design is how we choose who takes part in the survey - this is known as sampling. There are two main approaches: probability sampling, where individuals are chosen at random and everyone in the population has a known (non-zero) chance of being selected, and non-probability sampling, where people are selected in a more informal or purposive way - such as when internet users choose to take part in an online poll.\nProbability sampling is preferred in social research because it reduces the risk of getting a biased or unrepresentative sample. For example, if some groups in the population are under-represented or left out completely, the survey results will not reflect the wider population. Textbooks often refer to simple random sampling - where individuals are picked entirely at random from a full list (or sampling frame) of the population - as the ideal method for ensuring accurate and unbiased estimates.\nHowever, simple random sampling is rarely possible in large-scale, real-world surveys. This can be because some countries, including the UK, don’t have a complete national population register that researchers can use as a a sampling frame to list every individual. Instead, other forms of sampling are used. These might involve selecting households, addresses, schools, or other units where reliable lists exist.\nMoreover, simple random sampling is not always the most efficient method. In some cases, certain groups in the population may be less likely to respond to surveys, or the research may need more precise data about specific sub-groups. In such cases, it makes sense to over-sample these groups to ensure the results are meaningful.\nDesigning a survey is all about finding the right balance: one want the sample to be representative and large enough for precise results, but one also needs to keep costs down. For that reason, most large social surveys in the UK use more complex sampling methods than simple random sampling. For instance, to ensure good representation across the UK, surveys often take separate samples for England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. If the goal is to produce reliable estimates for particular groups - such as ethnic minorities - those groups may also be deliberately over-sampled.\nTwo common techniques used in complex survey designs are clustering and stratification.\nClustering is a common technique in survey design, especially in large-scale studies. Its usage implies multistage sampling, which means selecting sample units in two or more steps rather than all at once.\nInstead of sampling individuals directly, the population is first grouped into clusters small groups that are each a kind of ‘mini-population’. These clusters are chosen so that they are as diverse as possible internally, meaning that each one looks like a small version of the full population. A sample of these clusters is then randomly selected, and others are left out. Later stages of sampling take place within the selected clusters.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Clustering in the UK Context\nIn Great Britain, there is no national population register listing all individuals. The best available alternative is a list of addresses maintained by Royal Mail, called the Postcode Address File (PAF). In Northern Ireland, the equivalent is the list provided by the Land and Property Services Agency (LPSA).\nThe PAF contains addresses (also called “delivery points”) but doesn’t tell us how many people or households live at each one. So we can’t use it for simple random sampling of individuals or households. However, it is well suited for geographic clustering.\nFor example:\n\nEvery address is part of a postcode (e.g. M13 9PL),\nWhich belongs to a postcode sector (e.g. M13 9),\nWhich in turn is part of a postcode district (e.g. M13).\n\nIn many UK surveys, postcode sectors or districts are used as Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) - the first level at which random selection happens. This approach helps keep fieldwork practical and affordable by limiting travel distances and interviewer time.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Example of Two-Stage Cluster Sampling\n\n\nIn Figure 1, the population is grouped into four postcode districts. Districts 1 and 4 are randomly selected as the Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). In the second stage, addresses are randomly selected within these chosen districts. Because only some districts are selected, the final addresses are clustered within them. Later stages might involve sampling households or individuals from those addresses.\nThis design is common in UK household surveys, where geography plays a big role in cost and logistics.\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Clustering at the Household Level\nClustering can also happen within households. For example, some UK household surveys (like the Labour Force Survey) include all individuals in a selected household.\nImagine we want to estimate the proportion of people born outside the UK. If we select individuals completely at random across the whole population, we might get a very accurate estimate. But if we sample whole households, the result could be less precise.\nHere’s why: people born outside the UK often live together. So in your sample, you might get:\n\nSome households with only UK-born people,\nSome with only overseas-born,\nA few mixed.\n\nThat means the sample might over- or under-represent certain groups just by chance.\n\n1.1.2.1 Example:\ne.g.\nHousehold 1: 1 UK born individuals \nHousehold 2: 3 UK born \nHousehold 3: 2 Overseas born \nHousehold 4: 6 UK born \nHousehold 5: 1 Overseas born, 1 UK born \nHousehold 6: 2 UK born \nHousehold 7: 1 UK born \nHousehold 8: 1 UK born \nHousehold 9: 5 Overseas born \nHousehold 10: 3 UK born \nIf we sampled only 1 in every 10 households, this clustering would make our estimate of the UK-born proportion less precise than if individuals were selected randomly from across the population.\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Trade-offs of Clustering\nClustering makes sampling more practical and cost-effective—but it comes with a trade-off: reduced precision. Because we are leaving out clusters from the population we are sampling from, we are making it ‘coarser’, and are capturing less overall diversity. This means estimates based on clustered data are generally less precise and may need larger sample sizes or other adjustments to compensate.\nWe’ll return to this idea when we discuss how to account for clustering in data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n%%{\ninit: {\n  \"themeVariables\": { 'primaryColor': '#C6A6CD',\n                      'primaryTextColor': '#000',\n                      'primaryBorderColor': '#7C0000',\n                      'lineColor': '#F8B229',\n                      'secondaryColor': '#FADD99',\n                      'tertiaryColor': '#fff',\n                      'nodeTextColor': '#a6a7a7'},\n  \"theme\": 'base'\n}}%%\n\n\nflowchart TD\n    A[FULL POPULATION] --&gt; B[Grouped into clusters &lt;br/&gt;e.g. postcode districts]   \n    B --&gt; C[Sampling of clusters &lt;br/&gt;Primary Sampling Units]  \n    C --&gt; D[Further sampling:  &lt;br/&gt;households, individuals]\n\n\n Visual Summary: Clustering in Survey Sampling \n\n\n\nstyle A fill:#C6A6CD\nstyle B fill:#C6A6CD\nstyle C fill:#EB99BC\nstyle D fill:#ABBBD5\nKey Points to Remember:\n\nClustering simplifies data collection but reduces precision.\nIt is often combined with multistage sampling.\nHousehold-level clustering also affects estimates.\nAlways account for clustering during analysis to avoid misleading results.",

    "section": "1.2 Stratification",
    "text": "1.2 Stratification\nStratification is another important technique used in survey sampling. It involves dividing the population into different groups - called strata - and then selecting a sample from each group. This ensures that important subgroups are properly represented in the final sample, even if they are small or harder to reach.\n\n1.2.1 How is stratification different from clustering?\nIn clustering, each selected group (such as a postcode district) is a mini version of the population - as it is designed to be internally diverse. In stratification, the groups are made to be as homogeneous as possible - people in each stratum share certain traits (like age or location), and this helps make groups comparisons more precise.\n\n\n1.2.2 Example: Stratification by Region\nImagine we split the population into four regions: North, South, East, and West. From each region, we randomly select a fixed number of addresses - say, five from each. This ensures every region is covered in the sample, no matter how small or different it is.\nFigure 2 shows how samples are drawn evenly across regional strata.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: An example of stratified sampling\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Stratification in UK Social Surveys\nStrata in UK surveys are often based on:\n\nGeographic areas, such as Government Office Regions\nSocio-economic characteristics, like car ownership or job types in an area\nDemographic traits, such as the number of pensioners or the area’s population density\n\nThis information usually comes from Census data, which provides a detailed picture of the population across the country.\n\n\n1.2.4 Why Use Stratification?\nStratification is especially useful when:\n\nSome groups in the population are small but important (e.g. ethnic minorities, rural areas, younger people)\nOne needs to improve estimates precision - by reducing variation within each group\nOne needs reliable results for every group, not just for the population overall\n\nBy making sure each group is adequately represented, stratification helps improve the accuracy and representativeness of survey estimates",

    "text": "1.3 Proportionate vs disproportionate sampling\nIn simple random sampling, every person (or unit) in the population has the same chance of being selected. This means that the sampling fraction—the proportion of the population included in the sample—is calculated as:\n\\[\n  \\text{Sampling fraction} = \\frac{n}{N}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(n\\) = sample size\n\\(N\\) = population size\n\n\n1.3.1 Proportionate Stratified Sampling\nWhen the same sampling fraction is used in each strata, we call it proportionate stratification. That means:\n\\[\n  \\frac{n_h}{N_h} = \\frac{n}{N}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(n_h\\) = number of people sampled in stratum \\(h\\)\n\\(N_h\\) = total number of people in stratum \\(h\\)\n\nThis method ensures that each group is represented in proportion to its size in the population.\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Disproportionate Stratified Sampling\nSometimes, researchers deliberately over-sample certain groups. This is called disproportionate stratification - when the sampling fraction is larger in some strata than others.\nThis is useful when:\n\nThe group is small but important for the study (e.g. ethnic minorities, people in rural areas)\nMore data is needed to analyse that group accurately\n\nExample: In the British Election Study 2010, people from ethnic minority backgrounds were over-sampled.

However, this is not always possible. In real-world research, trade-offs often need to be made depending on the circumstances. Below are some key considerations.\nMost datasets provided by the UK Data Service (UKDS) are available as Safeguarded data provided under the End User Licence (EUL). This makes access easier for many users, with minimal formalities. However, a key limitation is that survey design variables are often not included as data producers sometimes leave them out due to concerns about the perceived risk of personal information disclosure.\nSome datasets do include design variables. Notable examples are:\nWith certain large scale government surveys – such as the Labour Force Survey and the Family Resources Survey, users may apply for access to a version of the data that does include survey design information via the SecureLab or at the UKDS Safe Room.\nHowever, applying for access to these facilities can be time-consuming and may not be practical for all researchers, especially those outside academia or large organisations. More information on Types of data access can be found on the UK Data Service website.\nMany surveys also do not offer this kind of controlled access at all.

    "text": "3.3 Complexity of the analysis\nThe complexity of your analysis will also affect whether how crucial it is to use survey design variables.\nFor example:\n\nAnalyses based on small sample sizes are more likely to produce misleading results if design variables are ignored.\nSubgroup analysis (also known as domain estimation) requires more advanced techniques. This is because the weighting must reflect the whole population, not just the subgroup.\n\nAgain, think of analysis as a spectrum:\n\nAt one end: simple descriptive statistics involving the full population.\nAt the other: complex analyses of small subgroups or multivariate models.\n\nSimple descriptive work, especially if it involves a large sample size is more forgiving. However, detailed subgroup or multivariate analysis benefits significantly from the use of design variables as estimates are likely to be less precise.\nIn some cases, the estimates you need may already have been published by the data producer using appropriate methods. In other cases, the data producer may supply design factors—pre-calculated numbers to help adjust standard errors when design variables are not available.\nExamples are available below for the Labour Force Survey and the Family Resources Survey.",

Using weights without specifying the survey design can lead to problems.\n\n3.4.1 Common issues with direct/on the fly weighting:\n\nPoint estimates (like means or proportions) will usually be correct.\nBut standard errors and confidence intervals will often be incorrect because by default the software assumes that the data was collected simple random sampling.\nThis can lead to over- or under-estimation of variability—especially when analysing small subgroups.\nSome software, like SPSS and SAS, calculate standard errors using population totals instead of sample totals when using direct weighting. This can lead to completely incorrect confidence intervals and significance tests.\n\nOther software, like Stata, won’t allow confidence intervals or weights to be used correctly unless you use the proper survey commands.

    "text": "Strategy 1: The most robust approach is to use both weights and survey design variables with survey-specific commands. This should always be the first choice. In practice, though, design variables may not be available, or access to them may require applying for special versions of the data, which can be time-consuming.\nStrategy 2: If design variables are not available, the next best option is to use weights with survey-specific commands. Point estimates will be the same as in Strategy 1, but confidence intervals and standard errors may be biased (too narrow or too wide depending on the design). In these cases, it is important to acknowledge the limitation in reporting results. Sometimes, design effects provided in the documentation can help correct standard errors.\nStrategy 3: Some users apply weights in standard commands (e.g. weighted means or regressions without survey commands). This often gives correct point estimates but can produce misleading confidence intervals or standard errors. In SAS and SPSS the values may be entirely incorrect, while in R and Stata they may sometimes be close to those obtained with Strategy 2. This approach should only be used for low-sensitivity analyses. Design factors (if published) can sometimes be used to improve these results.\nStrategy 4: Unweighted estimation is strongly discouraged for inference, as the results will almost always be unreliable. It is only acceptable for descriptive or teaching purposes where precision is not the focus.",

At the same time, R Base does not provide a unified sets of commands or syntax for computing weighted estimates. Implementation of statistical theory may vary between packages, but algorithms are usually described in detail in the package documentation.\nIn the example below, we will practice statistical inference with data from the 2017 British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) taking into account weights and survey design variables. Please note that at the time of writing this document only some issues of the BSA include survey design variables.\nWe first need to find out about the survey design that was used in the 2017 BSA, and the design variables that are made available in the dataset. Such information can usually be found in the documentation that comes together with the data under the mrdoc/pdf folder.\nQuestion 1 What is the design that was used in this survey (i.e. how many stages were there, and what were the units sampled). What were the primary sampling units; the strata (if relevant)?\nNow that we are a bit more familiar with the way the survey was designed, we need to try and identify the design variables we can include when producing estimates. The information can usually be found in the user manual or the data dictionary available under mrdoc/ukda_data_dictionaries.zip The file may need to be decompressed separately.\nQuestion 2 What survey design variables are available?

    "text": "Computing domain estimates\nComputing domain estimates, that is estimates for subgroups adds a layer of complexity to the above example. They key point is that as weights are usually designed using the whole of the sample by data producers, confidence intervals or standard errors computed using only part of the sample may be unreliable, as they will rely on some of the weights only. Instead, it is recommended to use commands that take into account the entire distribution of the weights.\nIn R, the command that does this is svyby()\nFor instance, if we would like to compute the mean age of BSA respondents by Government Office Regions, we need to specify:\n\nThe outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: i.e. RAgeE\nThe grouping variable(s) GOR_ID\nThe estimate function we are going to use here: svymean, the same as we used before\nAnd the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see displayed i.e. standard errors or confidence interval\n\n\nround(\n  svyby(~RAgeE,by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),svymean,design=bsa17.s,vartype = \"ci\")[-1]\n  ,1)\n\n                           RAgeE ci_l ci_u\nA North East                46.1 43.6 48.6\nB North West                49.6 47.3 52.0\nD Yorkshire and The Humber  48.0 45.2 50.8\nE East Midlands             48.6 45.9 51.3\nF West Midlands             48.1 45.0 51.2\nG East of England           49.0 46.0 52.0\nH London                    45.0 43.0 46.9\nJ South East                48.0 45.1 50.8\nK South West                53.4 51.5 55.2\nL Wales                     49.1 45.1 53.1\nM Scotland                  47.3 44.7 50.0\n\n\nNote: we used [-1] from the object created by svyby() in order to remove a column with alphanumeric values (the region names), so that we could round the results without getting an error.\nOur inference seem to suggest that the population in London is among the youngest in the country, and that those in the South West are among the oldest – their respective 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. We should not feel so confident about differences between London and the South East for example, as the CIs partially overlap.\nWe can follow a similar approach with proportions: we just need to specify the category of the variable we are interested in as an outcome, for instance respondents who are significantly interested in politics, and replace svymean by svyciprop.\n\nround(\n  100*\n    svyby(~I(Politics==1 | Politics==2),\n          by=~as_factor(GOR_ID),\n          svyciprop,\n          design=bsa17.s,\n          vartype = \"ci\")[-1],\n  1)\n\n                           I(Politics == 1 | Politics == 2) ci_l ci_u\nA North East                                           33.4 26.6 40.9\nB North West                                           41.9 36.1 48.0\nD Yorkshire and The Humber                             35.6 29.1 42.6\nE East Midlands                                        36.9 32.9 41.1\nF West Midlands                                        36.3 31.5 41.5\nG East of England                                      47.2 41.4 53.1\nH London                                               54.2 47.2 61.1\nJ South East                                           44.6 38.7 50.8\nK South West                                           46.5 39.4 53.8\nL Wales                                                38.6 27.7 50.7\nM Scotland                                             42.7 36.0 49.8\n\n\nQuestion 5 What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West? Is the proportion likely to be different in London? In what way? What is the region of the UK for which the precision of the estimates is likely to be the smallest?\nQuestion 6 Using interest in politics as before, and three category age RAgecat5:\n\nProduce a table of results showing the proportion of respondents significantly interested in Politics by age group and gender\nAssess whether the age difference in interest for politics is similar for each gender?\nBased on the data, is it fair to say that men aged under 35 tend to be more likely to declare themselves interested in politics than women aged 55 and above?\n\n## Inference without survey design variables using R\nExample: count and proportion of the regional population of the UK using the LFS with End User License (EUL)\nAs a rule, EUL versions of the LFS do not include sample design variables. On the other hand they come with two weight variables:\n\npwt22 for estimation with the whole sample\npiwt22 for estimation of income using respondents currently in employment (and accounting for the high level of non response for the earnings variables)\n\nEstimation without accounting for sample design will likely be biased and should be reported as such including warnings, even if the nature (over or underestimation of the precision) and and size are not known. An alternative is to look for design effects tables published by the data producer which could be used to correct for the bias.\nThe Office for National Statistics regularly publishes such tables for the LFS, albeit mostly for their headline statistics. Obtaining further design effects for subpopulations might not be straighforward. The overall methodology is described in this note, and updated tables are provided on this page.\nLet’s see how this can be achieved. But first, let’s produce uncorrected ‘naive’ estimates of the regional population.\n\nlfs&lt;-read_dta((paste0(datadir,\"lfs/UKDA-8999-stata/lfsp_aj22_eul_pwt22.dta\")))%&gt;%\n  select(PWT22,PIWT22,URESMC,ILODEFR)\nnames(lfs)&lt;-tolower(names(lfs))\nlfs$uresmc.f&lt;-droplevels(as_factor(lfs$uresmc))\nlfs.s&lt;-svydesign(ids=~1,weights=~piwt22,data=lfs%&gt;%filter(ilodefr==1)) \nround(confint(svytotal(~uresmc.f,lfs.s)))\n\n                                     2.5 %  97.5 %\nuresmc.fTyne & Wear                 375843  544677\nuresmc.fRest of Northern region     679067  875001\nuresmc.fSouth Yorkshire             361987  542893\nuresmc.fWest Yorkshire              892298 1139996\nuresmc.fRest of Yorks & Humberside  688398  901578\nuresmc.fEast Midlands              1884931 2240257\nuresmc.fEast Anglia                1018147 1293525\nuresmc.fInner London               1403277 1950147\nuresmc.fOuter London               2061142 2573440\nuresmc.fRest of South East         5133587 5816347\nuresmc.fSouth West                 2150551 2532611\nuresmc.fWest Midlands (met county)  921916 1255744\nuresmc.fRest of West Midlands      1249939 1571219\nuresmc.fGreater Manchester         1041396 1341426\nuresmc.fMerseyside                  473854  749424\nuresmc.fRest of North West          929920 1205848\nuresmc.fWales                      1101246 1410746\nuresmc.fStrathclyde                 722247 1020673\nuresmc.fRest of Scotland           1356361 1750183\nuresmc.fNorthern Ireland            689076  803340\n\n\nIn the above example, we are working with the most commonly used flavour of the Labour Force Survey: the quarterly edition.

Primary sampling units were stratified according to geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode sectors (i.e. number of addresses).\nQuestion 2 From the Data Dictionary it appears that the primary sampling units (sub regions) are identified by Spoint and the strata by StratID. The weights variable is WtFactor. Addresses are not provided but could be approximated with a household identifier.\nQuestion 3 Not using weights would make us overestimate the mean age in the population (of those aged 16+) by about 4 years. This is likely to be due to the fact that older respondents are more likely to take part to surveys. Using survey design variables does not alter the value of the estimated population mean. However, not accounting for it would lead us to overestimate the precision/underestimate the uncertainty of our estimate with a narrower confidence interval – by about plus or minus 3 months.\nQuestion 4 The proportion of 17-34 year old in the sample is 28.5 and its 95% confidence interval 26.5, 30.6\nQuestion 5 The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West is 39.8-53.4. By contrast, it is 47.6-60.8 in London. The region with the lowest precision of estimates (i.e. the widest confidence interval) is Wales, with a 20 percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\nQuestion 6\n\n\n             I(Politics.s == \"Significantly\") ci_l ci_u\n17-34.Male                               42.9 37.7 48.2\n35-54.Male                               50.8 46.6 54.9\n55+.Male                                 57.8 53.9 61.6\n17-34.Female                             26.3 22.0 31.1\n35-54.Female                             34.1 30.6 37.8\n55+.Female                               43.0 39.6 46.5\n\n\nOlder respondents both male and female tend to be more involved in politics than younger ones.\nThe confidence interval for the proportion of men under 35 and women above 55 interested in politics overlaps; it is unlikely that they differ in the population.\n\n\n\n\nBlair, Johnny. 2014.

    "text": "Identifying the survey design and variables\nAt the time of writing this document (September 2023) Standard editions of SPSS did not include support for estimation with survey design variables, and only limited use of sampling weights. When using grossing weights – i.e. weight that have been designed to enable computing population totals from sample data – as is the case for instance with the Labour Force and Family Resources surveys, measures of dispersion and standard errors will not be adequately computed. It is therefore not recommended to attempt using the base version of SPSS with survey data beyond estimating point estimates. Significance testing, and standard errors will not reflect the correct values. Users wanting to use SPSS with survey data will need to acquire the Premium Edition or the Complex Samples add-on of the software.\nIn this exercise, we will practice statistical inference with data from the 2017 British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) taking into account weights and survey design variables. Please note that at the time of writing this document only some of the BSA editions include survey design variables.\nWe first need to find out about the survey design that was used in the 2017 BSA, and the design variables that are made available in the dataset. Such information can usually be found in the documentation that comes together with the data under the mrdoc/pdf folder.\nQuestion 1 What is the design that was used in this survey (i.e. how many stages were there, and what were the units sampled). What were the primary sampling units; the strata (if relevant)?\nNow that we are a bit more familiar with the way the survey was designed, we need to try and identify the design variables we can include when producing estimates. The information can usually be found in the user manual or the data dictionary available under mrdoc/ukda_data_dictionaries.zip You may need to decompress the file separately\nQuestion 2 What survey design variables are available? Are there any ones that are missing – if so which ones? What is the name of the weights variables?\n## Specifying the survey design\nLet us first open the 2017 BSA dataset.\nIn principle, we should tell SPSS that we are working with a three stage stratified cluster sample. In practice however, we only have information about the initial i.e. primary sampling units.\nThis is achieved with the CSPLAN command through we create a plan file which contains the survey design information.",

    "text": "Domain (i.e. subpopulation) estimates\nAlthough computing estimates for specific groups (for example the average age of people who report being interested in politics) is not conceptually different from doing it for the sample as a whole, doing it with weights as part of an inferential analysis requires some caution. Calculating weighted estimates for a subpopulation while the rest of the sample is left out of the analysis might yield incorrect results. This is why using survey design informed functions is particularly recommended when doing such analyses.\nThe SPSS command CSDESCRIPTIVES that we used above makes such domain estimation relatively straightforward. If we would like to compute the mean age of BSA respondents by government office regions, we need to specify:\n\nThe outcome variable whose estimate we want to compute: i.e. RAgeE\nThe grouping variable(s) GOR_ID\nAnd the type of type of variance estimation we would like to see displayed i.e. standard errors or confidence interval\n\n* Complex Samples Descriptives.\nCSDESCRIPTIVES\n/PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'\n/SUMMARY VARIABLES=RAgeE\n/SUBPOP TABLE=GOR_ID DISPLAY=LAYERED\n/MEAN\n/STATISTICS CIN(95)\n/MISSING SCOPE=ANALYSIS CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.\nOur inference seem to suggest that the population in London is among the youngest in the country, and that those in the South West are among the oldest – their respective 95% confidence intervals do not overlap. We should not feel so confident about differences between London and the South East for example, as the CIs partially overlap.\nWe can also examine proportions for subpopulations. In order to do this, we need to specify the category of the variable we are interested in as an outcome.

Is the proportion likely to be different in London? In what way? What is the region of the UK for which the precision of the estimates is likely to be the smallest?\nWhen using CSTABULATE, we can define domains or subpopulations with several variables, not just one. For example, we could look at gender differences in political affiliations by regions. However, as the size of subgroups decrease, so does the precision of the estimates as their confidence interval widens, to a point where their substantive interest is not meaningful anymore.\nQuestion 6 Using interest in politics as before, and three category age RAgecat5:\n\nProduce a table of results showing the proportion of respondents significantly interested in Politics by age group and gender\nAssess whether the age difference in interest for politics is similar for each gender?\nBased on the data, is it fair to say that men aged under 35 tend to be more likely to declare themselves interested in politics than women aged 55 and above?\n\nCSTABULATE\n/PLAN FILE='bsa17_SPSS_design.csaplan'\n/TABLES VARIABLES=Politics.s\n/SUBPOP TABLE=Rsex BY RAgecat5 DISPLAY=LAYERED\n/CELLS TABLEPCT\n/STATISTICS CIN(95) \n/MISSING SCOPE=TABLE CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE.\n\nAnswers\nQuestion 1 The 2017 BSA is a three stage stratified random survey, with postcode sectors, adresses and individuals as the units selected at each stage. Primary sampling units were stratified according to geographies (sub regions), population density, and proportion of owner-occupiers. Sampling rate was proportional to the size of postcode sectors (i.e. number of addresses).\nQuestion 2 From the Data Dictionary it appears that the primary sampling units (sub regions) are identified by Spoint and the strata by StratID. The weights variable is WtFactor. Addresses are not provided but could be approximated with a household identifier.\nQuestion 3 Not using weights would make us overestimate the mean age in the population (of those aged 16+) by about 4 years. This is likely to be due to the fact that older respondents are more likely to take part to surveys. Using survey design variables does not alter the value of the estimated population mean. However, not accounting for it would lead us to overestimate the precision/underestimate the uncertainty of our estimate with a narrower confidence interval – by about plus or minus 3 months.\nQuestion 4 The proportion of 17-34 year old in the sample is 28.5 and its 95% confidence interval 26.5, 30.6\nQuestion 5 The 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West is 39.8-53.4. By contrast, it is 47.6-60.8 in London. The region with the lowest precision of estimates (i.e. the widest confidence interval) is Wales, with a 20 percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\nQuestion 6\n\n\n             I(Politics.s == \"Significantly\") ci_l ci_u\n17-34.Male                               42.9 37.7 48.2\n35-54.Male                               50.8 46.6 54.9\n55+.Male                                 57.8 53.9 61.6\n17-34.Female                             26.3 22.0 31.1\n35-54.Female                             34.1 30.6 37.8\n55+.Female                               43.0 39.6 46.5\n\n\nOlder respondents both male and female tend to be more involved in politics than younger ones.\nThe confidence interval for the proportion of men under 35 and women above 55 interested in politics overlaps; it is unlikely that they differ in the population.\n\n\n\n\nBlair, Johnny. 2014.

    "text": "Identifying the survey design and variables\nStata provides comprehensive support for computing estimates from survey data using weights and survey design variables. Perhaps a bit confusingly to some users, it distinguishes between four weighted estimation techniques, also called weights:\nThese mostly differ in the way standard errors are estimated.\nIn most cases, survey weights available in UKDS datasets should be treated as probability weights in Stata jargon. Indeed not all of the above weighting methods were designed to work with survey data.\nAs other statistical software, weighted estimation in Stata can either be performed:\nAt the same time, a feature of Stata is that a number of basic estimation commands, such as summarise or tabulate. This is meant to nudge users of survey data to prioritise the survey estimation commands rather than command-based weighting.\nIn the example below, we will practice statistical inference with data from the 2017 British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) taking into account weights and survey design variables. Please note that at the time of writing this document only some issues of the BSA include survey design variables.\nWe first need to find out about the survey design that was used in the 2017 BSA, and the design variables that are made available in the dataset. Such information can usually be found in the documentation that comes together with the data under the mrdoc/pdf folder.\nNow that we are a bit more familiar with the way the survey was designed, we need to try and identify the design variables we can include when producing estimates. The information can usually be found in the user manual or the data dictionary available under mrdoc/ukda_data_dictionaries.zip The file may need to be decompressed separately.",

    "text": "Domain estimates\nDomain estimates refer to estimates for groups or subpopulations, which adds a layer of complexity to what we have done so far. They key point is that as survey weights are usually designed by data producers using the whole of the sample, confidence intervals and standard errors computed using only part of the sample - such as for example when subsetting the dataset or removing observations - may be unreliable, as they will rely on some of the weights only. Instead, it is recommended to use commands that take into account the entire distribution of the weights.\nIn Stata, this can be either achieved with subpop() or over.\nsubpop() computes estimates for single groups identified either by a dummy variable (ie coded 0-1), or by a conditional statement. For instance, if we would like to know the mean age of BSA respondents in the North East, we need to specify (using the Government Office Regions GOR_ID variable):\n\nsvy, subpop(if GOR_ID==1):mean RAgeE\n\n. svy, subpop(if GOR_ID==1):mean RAgeE\n(running mean on estimation sample)\n\nSurvey: Mean estimation\n\nNumber of strata =  8             Number of obs   =        214\nNumber of PSUs   = 19             Population size = 199.035253\n                                  Subpop. no. obs =        180\n                                  Subpop. size    = 167.274844\n                                  Design df       =         11\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n             |             Linearized\n             |       Mean   std. err.

Is the proportion likely to be different in London? In what way? What is the region of the UK for which the precision of the estimates is likely to be the smallest?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people interested in politics in the South West in 2017 was 39.8-53.4. By contrast, it was 47.6-60.8 in London. The region with the lowest precision of estimates (i.e. the widest confidence interval) was Wales, with a 20 percentage point difference between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipQuestion 6 *Using interest in politics as before, and three category age RAgecat5: 1. Produce a table of results showing the proportion of respondents significantly interested in politics by age group and gender; 2. Assess whether the age difference in interest in politics is similar for each gender; 3.

    "text": "Inference without survey design variables\nExample: count and proportion of the regional population of the UK using Quarterly Labour Force Survey safeguarded data\nAs a rule, safeguarded versions of the LFS do not include sample design variables. On the other hand they include two weight variables:\n\npwt22 for estimation with the whole sample\npiwt22 for estimation of income using respondents currently in employment (and accounting for the high level of non response for the earnings variables)\n\nEstimation without accounting for sample design will likely be biased and should be reported as such including warnings, even if the nature (over or underestimation of the precision) and and size are not known. An alternative is to look for design effects tables published by the data producer which could be used to correct for the bias.\nThe Office for National Statistics regularly publishes such tables for the LFS, albeit mostly for their headline statistics. Obtaining further design effects for subpopulations might not be straighforward.

This has to be done by hand, by directly copying the relevant numbers from the LFS documentation.\nFor example, if we wanted to adjust the population estimates for London, we would need to start with the original standard error, multiply it by the relevanmt design effect, then compute the 95% confidence interval of the point estimate. The design effect for London is smaller than 1, which indicates that the confidence interval after correction will be narrower - more precise than when simple random sampling was assumed.\nHere is the adjusted standard error for London:\n\ndis 294956.8*0.9634\n\n. dis 294956.8*0.9634\n284161.38\n\n\n… The corresponding lower bound of the confidence interval\n\ndis 5912194-1.96*(294956.8*0.9634)\n\n. dis 5912194-1.96*(294956.8*0.9634)\n5355237.7\n\n\n… And the upper bound\n\ndis 5912194+1.96*(294956.8*0.9634)\n\n. dis 5912194+1.96*(294956.8*0.9634)\n6469150.3\n\n\n… Instead of the original one:\n[5334080 -6490308]\nWe can see that it is indeed narrower.\nNote: it would be possible to produce an amended table in full, using Stata’s MATA functions.\n\nmat input deff= (0.8712,1.0857,1.3655,1.0051,0.9634,1.0382,0.8936,1.3272,0.9677,0.9137, 1.0012,1.0437,0.7113)\n\nmat orig= e(b)',r(table)[\"se\",.]',deff',hadamard(r(table)[\"se\",.],deff)'\n\n*mat ciL = test[.,\"total\"]-(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)\n*tot[\"97.5%\"]&lt;-tot$total+(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)\n*rownames(tot)&lt;-substr(rownames(tot),10,nchar(rownames(tot)))\n*kable(round(tot[,c(\"2.5%\",\"97.5%\")]))\n\n\n. mat input deff= (0.8712,1.0857,1.3655,1.0051,0.9634,1.0382,0.8936,1.3272,0.96\n&gt; 77,0.9137, 1.0012,1.0437,0.7113)\n\n. \n. mat orig= e(b)',r(table)[\"se\",.]',deff',hadamard(r(table)[\"se\",.],deff)'\n\n. \n. *mat ciL = test[.,\"total\"]-(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)\n. *tot[\"97.5%\"]&lt;-tot$total+(1.96*tot$SE*tot$deft)\n. *rownames(tot)&lt;-substr(rownames(tot),10,nchar(rownames(tot)))\n. *kable(round(tot[,c(\"2.5%\",\"97.5%\")]))\n. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlair, Johnny. 2014.
