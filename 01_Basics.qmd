# Basics of Survey Design

At the heart of survey design is how we choose who takes part in the
survey - this is known as sampling. There are two main approaches:
**probability sampling**, where individuals are chosen at random and
everyone in the population has a known (non-zero) chance of being
selected, and **non-probability sampling**, where people are selected in
a more informal or purposive way - such as when internet users choose to
take part in an online poll.

Probability sampling is preferred in social research because it reduces
the risk of getting a biased or unrepresentative sample. For example, if
some groups in the population are under-represented or left out
completely, the survey results will not reflect the wider population.
Textbooks often refer to **simple random sampling** - where individuals
are picked entirely at random from a full list (or *sampling frame*) of
the population - as the ideal method for ensuring accurate and unbiased
estimates.

However, simple random sampling is rarely possible in large-scale,
real-world surveys. This can be because some countries, including the
UK, don't have a complete national population register that researchers
can use as a a sampling frame to list every individual. Instead, other
forms of sampling are used. These might involve selecting households,
addresses, schools, or other units where reliable lists exist.

Moreover, simple random sampling is not always the most efficient
method. In some cases, certain groups in the population may be less
likely to respond to surveys, or the research may need more precise data
about specific sub-groups. In such cases, it makes sense to
**over-sample** these groups to ensure the results are meaningful.

Designing a survey is all about finding the right balance: one want the
sample to be representative and large enough for precise results, but
one also needs to keep costs down. For that reason, most large social
surveys in the UK use more complex sampling methods than simple random
sampling. For instance, to ensure good representation across the UK,
surveys often take separate samples for England, Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland. If the goal is to produce reliable estimates for
particular groups - such as ethnic minorities - those groups may also be
deliberately over-sampled.

Two common techniques used in complex survey designs are **clustering**
and **stratification**.

<!-- Collecting data about people at random is not always straightforward. In the UK, we lack a full sampling frame - a complete list of all residents. Even if we had one, not everyone would be equally likely to take part to a survey. As a result, most UK social surveys rely on alternative sampling techniques such as **multi-stage clustering**, **stratification**, and **sampling proportionate to size**. -->

<!-- For example, in *sampling proportionate to size*, large Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) are oversampled compared to smaller ones. However, fewer secondary units are drawn from large PSUs than from smaller ones. This strategy can still ensure equal selection probabilities across individuals, even when a multi-stage design is used. -->

<!-- Overall, these techniques aim to strike a balance between: -->

<!-- - managing non-response, -->

<!-- - dealing with unequal selection probabilities, -->

<!-- - improving representativeness for hard-to-reach groups, and -->

<!-- - reducing fieldwork costs. -->

## Clustering in Survey Sampling

Clustering is a common technique in survey design, especially in
large-scale studies. Its usage implies **multistage sampling**, which
means selecting sample units in two or more steps rather than all at
once.

Instead of sampling individuals directly, the population is first
grouped into **clusters** small groups that are each a kind of
'mini-population'. These clusters are chosen so that they are as diverse
as possible internally, meaning that each one looks like a small version
of the full population. A sample of these clusters is then randomly
selected, and others are left out. Later stages of sampling take place
within the selected clusters.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Clustering in the UK Context**

In Great Britain, there is no national population register listing all
individuals. The best available alternative is a list of addresses
maintained by Royal Mail, called the **Postcode Address File (PAF)**. In
Northern Ireland, the equivalent is the list provided by the **Land and
Property Services Agency (LPSA)**.

The PAF contains addresses (also called “delivery points”) but doesn’t
tell us how many people or households live at each one. So we can’t use
it for **simple random sampling** of individuals or households. However,
it is well suited for geographic clustering.

For example:

-   Every address is part of a **postcode** (e.g. M13 9PL),
-   Which belongs to a **postcode sector** (e.g. M13 9),
-   Which in turn is part of a **postcode district** (e.g. M13).

In many UK surveys, postcode sectors or districts are used as **Primary
Sampling Units (PSUs)** - the first level at which random selection
happens. This approach helps keep fieldwork practical and affordable by
limiting travel distances and interviewer time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------



![**Figure 1: Example of Two-Stage Cluster Sampling**](pics/cluster.png){fig-alt="Schematic representation of sample clustering"}

In Figure 1, the population is grouped into four postcode districts.
Districts 1 and 4 are randomly selected as the **Primary Sampling Units
(PSUs)**. In the second stage, addresses are randomly selected within
these chosen districts. Because only some districts are selected, the
final addresses are **clustered** within them. Later stages might
involve sampling households or individuals from those addresses.

This design is common in UK household surveys, where geography plays a
big role in cost and logistics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Clustering at the Household Level

Clustering can also happen within households. For example, some UK
household surveys (like the **Labour Force Survey**) include **all
individuals in a selected household**.

Imagine we want to estimate the proportion of people born outside the
UK. If we select individuals completely at random across the whole
population, we might get a very accurate estimate. But if we sample
whole households, the result could be less precise.

Here’s why: people born outside the UK often live together. So in your
sample, you might get:

-   Some households with only UK-born people,
-   Some with only overseas-born,
-   A few mixed.

That means the sample might over- or under-represent certain groups just
by chance.

#### Example:

e.g.

```         
Household 1: 1 UK born individuals 
Household 2: 3 UK born 
Household 3: 2 Overseas born 
Household 4: 6 UK born 
Household 5: 1 Overseas born, 1 UK born 
Household 6: 2 UK born 
Household 7: 1 UK born 
Household 8: 1 UK born 
Household 9: 5 Overseas born 
Household 10: 3 UK born 
```

If we sampled only 1 in every 10 households, this clustering would make
our estimate of the UK-born proportion **less precise** than if
individuals were selected randomly from across the population.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###  Trade-offs of Clustering

Clustering makes sampling more practical and cost-effective—but it comes
with a trade-off: **reduced precision**. Because we are leaving out
clusters from the population we are sampling from, we are making it
'coarser', and are capturing less overall diversity. This means
estimates based on clustered data are generally less precise and may
need **larger sample sizes** or other adjustments to compensate.

We’ll return to this idea when we discuss how to account for clustering
in data analysis.

**Key Points to Remember**:

-   Clustering simplifies data collection but reduces precision.
-   It is often combined with **multistage sampling**.
-   Household-level clustering also affects estimates.
-   Always account for clustering during analysis to avoid misleading
    results.

##  Stratification

Stratification is another important technique used in survey sampling.
It involves dividing the population into different groups - called
strata - and then selecting a sample from each group. This ensures that
important subgroups are properly represented in the final sample, even
if they are small or harder to reach.

###  How is stratification different from clustering?

In clustering, each selected group (such as a postcode district) is a
mini version of the population - as it is designed to be internally
diverse. In stratification, the groups are made to be as homogeneous as
possible - people in each stratum share certain traits (like age or
location), and this helps make groups comparisons more precise.

###  Example: Stratification by Region

Imagine we split the population into four regions: North, South, East,
and West. From each region, we randomly select a fixed number of
addresses - say, five from each. This ensures every region is covered in the sample, no matter how small or different it is.

Figure 2 shows how samples are drawn evenly across regional strata.

![**Figure 2: An example of stratified
sampling**](pics/strata.png){fig-alt="Schematic representation of sample stratification"}

### Stratification in UK Social Surveys

Strata in UK surveys are often based on:

-   Geographic areas, such as Government Office Regions

-   Socio-economic characteristics, like car ownership or job types in
    an area

-   Demographic traits, such as the number of pensioners or the area's
    population density

This information usually comes from Census data, which provides a
detailed picture of the population across the country.

###  Why Use Stratification?

Stratification is especially useful when:

-   Some groups in the population are small but important (e.g. ethnic
    minorities, rural areas, younger people)

-   One needs to improve estimates precision - by reducing variation
    within each group

-   One needs reliable results for every group, not just for the
    population overall

By making sure each group is adequately represented, stratification
helps improve the accuracy and representativeness of survey estimates

##  Proportionate vs disproportionate sampling

In **simple random sampling**, every person (or unit) in the population
has the **same chance** of being selected. This means that the
**sampling fraction**—the proportion of the population included in the
sample—is calculated as:

$$
  \text{Sampling fraction} = \frac{n}{N}
$$

Where:

-   $n$ = sample size
-   $N$ = population size

###  Proportionate Stratified Sampling

When the **same sampling fraction** is used in each strata, we call it
**proportionate stratification**. That means:

$$
  \frac{n_h}{N_h} = \frac{n}{N}
$$

Where:

-   $n_h$ = number of people sampled in stratum $h$
-   $N_h$ = total number of people in stratum $h$

This method ensures that each group is represented **in proportion to
its size** in the population.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

###  Disproportionate Stratified Sampling

Sometimes, researchers deliberately **over-sample** certain groups. This
is called **disproportionate stratification** - when the sampling
fraction is **larger in some strata than others**.

This is useful when:

-   The group is **small** but important for the study (e.g. ethnic
    minorities, people in rural areas)
-   More data is needed to analyse that group accurately

**Example:** In the **British Election Study 2010**, people from
ethnic minority backgrounds were over-sampled. This was done because
there was limited data on their voting behaviour, and researchers needed
enough cases to draw valid conclusions.
